# LeetCode

1. twoSum: (1) Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

2. recoverRotatedSortedArray: Given a rotated sorted array, recover it to sorted array in-place.（Ascending）

3. ReverseWordsInString: (151) Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

4. rotateString: Given a string(Given in the way of char array) and an offset, rotate the string by offset in place. (rotate from left to right).

5. search2DMatrixII: (74) Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

        Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
        The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

6. firstBadVersion: (278) You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad. You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

7. findPeakElement: (162) A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index. The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine. You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

8. strStr: (28) Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

9. mergeSortedArray: (88) Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
